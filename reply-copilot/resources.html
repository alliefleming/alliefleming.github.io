				  <div class="panel-body">
				    <p class="text-black">If you’re not responding to reviews (negative and positive) of your business, then you may be missing out on the opportunity to drive new business.</p>
					<p class="text-black">There are plenty of reasons why online customer reviews deserve a response on behalf of the brand or business. If you are already engaging in active review management, then we want to congratulate you. You are on the path to excellence in building your brand and your reputation. But before we go out and celebrate the success and impact of review responses, we must pause for just a moment and examine in depth not only what makes a great response but also the risks associated with thoughtless responses that fail to take into account the long-term value of the online business reputation of any organization.</p>
					<p class="text-black">A poorly answered review will, in the best of cases, disappoint the reviewer in question, and in the worst of cases result in a public relations conundrum that could go viral and tarnish your brand reputation for a very long time. Unfortunately, carelessness is rampant, and many small businesses have greatly damaged their credibility by answering reviews in a less-than-professional manner.</p>
					<p class="text-black">Many businesses are hasty and careless in the management of their online reputation. They fall into the trap of trying to engage reviewers without first drafting a document of best practices, or ensuring the person tasked to respond to reviews on behalf of the business is a good ambassador.</p>
					<p class="text-black">Empowerment, knowledge, and diplomacy are needed to handle each review, regardless of the rating with excellence and a clear, long-term marketing vision in mind. Common mistakes include poor grammar, language barriers, unwillingness to be solution-driven, and inconsistency regarding the level of care that is given to each response, thus conveying preferential treatment to some while neglecting others.</p>

				  <div class="panel-body">
				    <p class="text-black">If you have been managing your online reputation for a while now, then you have probably gotten into the habit of responding quickly to online customer reviews, in hopes of providing quick resolution to escalations and maintaining a good brand image across all review and social media sites.</p>
					<p class="text-black">The truth is, the majority of the time we highly endorse the implementation of standard operational procedures aimed toward taking care of all reviewers, either through acknowledging and thanking them for a compliment, or providing resolution or remedy for a complaint.</p>
					<p class="text-black">Today, however, we want to take a moment to explore with you certain business scenarios where you may want to be slow, careful, and intentional in the way you draft your review response. Understanding when not to rush into responding to an online review is of particular importance for those with limited experience in reputation management. A careless response in the scenarios we are about to discuss can significantly impact your online reputation and, in some situations, it may even expose your business to legal liability.</p>

				  <div class="panel-heading"><h4>Using the Net Promoter Score</h4></div>
				  <div class="panel-body">
				    <p class="text-black">Times have never been better than they are now in the field of consumer analytics and business intelligence.</p>
					<p class="text-black">Thanks to significant advances with the way we capture and reply to customer feedback, such as point-of-sale tracking and survey-based metrics, we can now paint a better and more accurate picture of what customers prefer and why.</p>
					<p class="text-black">In 2003, Bain &amp; Company, a global consulting firm based out of Boston, introduced a one-question survey that has proven to be one of the best and most accurate tools to measure and understand the customer sentiment toward a service or a product: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter" target="_blank">Net Promoter Score</a>. The firm began using the survey with some of their clients, and today NPS is one of the most popular tools for marketing and business strategists, equipping those tasked with determining the direction of a business with a key piece of data that is highly predictive of customers’ likelihood to repurchase or recommend a product or service.</p>
					<p class="text-black">The Net Promoter Score asks a single post-transactional question that surprisingly provides businesses with a variety of actionable insights, and one of the most valuable Key Performance Indicators available to business organizations.</p>
					<h4 class="text-gray">The question is simple: How likely is it that you would recommend Company X (or Product X) to a friend or colleague?</h4>
					<p class="text-black">Instead of a binary answer, those answering a Net Promoter Survey provide a linear assessment of their experience, with a rating scale of 0-10, ten being extremely likely to recommend and zero not likely at all. The responses are divided into three distinct categories or groups as follows:</p>
					<h4 class="text-green"><i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i> Positive: “Promoters”</h4>
				    <p class="text-black">These are highly loyal customers who conduct unprompted, repeat business and have no hesitation recommending the product or service to their friends, family, or colleagues (scores of nine and 10).</p>
					<h4 class="text-red"><i class="fa fa-times-circle"></i> Negative: “Detractors”</h4>
				    <p class="text-black">These are highly dissatisfied customers who are very unlikely to generate repeat business, much less give your business a verbal or written endorsement. These customers present a significant risk to your business organization since they are highly likely to give a negative reference about your business (scores of six and below).</p>
					<h4 class="text-gray"><i class="fa fa-minus-circle"></i> Neutral: “Passives”</h4>
				    <p class="text-black">These are satisfied but unenthusiastic customers, and your most vulnerable group since they can easily be persuaded to patronage the competition, should the competition be ready to bridge the experiential gap of what the customer wishes to receive and what you are delivering.</p>
					<p class="text-black">Conversely, just as this group (with scores of seven and eight) can easily stop frequenting your business, the same group, but from your competitor’s client pool, presents a superior opportunity for your business to gain wallet share if you have the business savvy and offerings to coax them to your side by carefully deciphering your competitors’ shortcomings.</p>
					<p class="text-black"><b>Here is an example:</b>
						<br />Total number of survey responses: 100
						<br />Total number of promoters: 40 (40%)
						<br />Total number of detractors: 10 (10%)
						<br />Total number of passives: 50 (50%)
						<br />Net Promoter Score in percentages: +30
					</p>
					<p class="text-black">Based on NPS samples collected by Bain & Company, businesses can feel confident they are trending in the right direction if they have a Net Promoter Score of +15 or more. The simplicity of this one-question survey makes it available to pretty much any business, regardless of size. Among companies currently using the NPS to gauge customer sentiment are: Expedia, Inc., CVS Caremark, The Home Depot, Macy’s, Southwest Airlines, American Express, Facebook, U.C. Berkeley, Intuit, Chick-fil-A, Porsche, Verizon, and BBC (among many others). Pretty solid list, right?</p>

				  <div class="panel-body">
				    <ul class="text-black">
					    <li>Promoters account for 80 percent of referrals across all industries.</li>
					    <li>Promoters are far more likely to submit an unprompted, positive online review than a passive one.</li>
					    <li>Detractors account for 80 percent of negative word of mouth.</li>
					    <li>Promoters are far more likely to repurchase and far more likely to engage with new product lines launched by your business.</li>
					    <li>A higher NPS is directly associated with significant decreases in customer churn rate.</li>

				  <div class="panel-heading"><h4>Assess and Build Customer Loyalty</h4></div>
				  <div class="panel-body">
				  	<p class="text-black">Net Promoter Score is one of the most predictable metrics when it comes to ongoing customer loyalty. It goes beyond customer satisfaction by capturing your customers’ willingness to advocate on your behalf and give a direct recommendation about your product or service. Net Promoter Score provides continuity by allowing you to make immediate changes in the business, and accurately measure how the changes you have made impact your customers’ likelihood to promote and advocate your offering.</p>
					<p class="text-black">In short, your NPS is your best partner when it comes to refining your marketing, operational, and customer experience strategy, giving you accountability every step of the way.</p>
					<p class="text-black"><b>The goal is simple:</b> to create an upward trend by making changes to the way you do business, and measuring how those changes change the way customers are willing to engage with your products or services.</p>
